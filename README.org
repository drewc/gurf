#+TITLE: Gurf, a (G)erbil/Gambit Scheme S(urf) Browser

I want a browser with a REPL that I can hack in Meta-Scheme. It has to be
useful. It has to be hackable. *Gurf* for the win!

* Installation

This is still in the hackety hack alpha, but soon to be very useful :). It's
currently for development use on an uptodate gerbil.

First off we need to install the following headers and libraries.

#+begin_src scheme
(def libs
  "x11 glib-2.0 gdk-3.0 atk gcr-3 webkit2gtk-4.0 webkit2gtk-web-extension-4.0 gio-2.0")
#+end_src

Then this should "just work".

#+begin_src shell
gxpkg install github.com/drewc/gurf
#+end_src

Binaries soon to come!

* Usage

This opens a browser window.

#+begin_src scheme
;;;; Gerbil v0.16-243-g87c6279b on Gambit v4.9.3-1540-gee1795ec
(import :drewc/gurf/surf)
(surf "http://google.ca")
#+end_src

* Developing

This is all Literate code using org-mode. Have a look at [[file:index.org][index.org]] for the,
well, index to the organisation of the literate code.
